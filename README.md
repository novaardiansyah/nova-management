# Nova Management

Hi Future Developer!

This time I want to create a web-based application to manage various personal needs, including financial management, studies, daily activities, scheduling, and reporting. This application will be directly connected to the REST API that I have created myself, and in the future, I will try to integrate it with several other applications such as Google Calendar, Google Drive, and others.

Of course, this application is still under development, and it still requires a lot of time and assistance from all of you. If you are interested in contributing, please fork this repository and make a pull request. If you want to provide suggestions or criticism, please create a new issue.

Thank you for your interest. Happy coding!
